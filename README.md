after downloading the .zip project files, extract the files and open in VS code.
Open a new terminal and enter, npm install.
Once the files update enter: npm run server, to start the backend server.
If you encounter an error for a missing component, for example express, in the terminal enter: npm install express.
If all the components are installed and your still getting errors, in the terminal enter: npm audit fix --force.
For some reason I have to run, npm audit fix --force, twice inorder for issues to be resolved.
